# solidity-projects-coin
I have created a Solidity projects Coin on Binance Smart Chain and Celo blockchain. These are ERC20 tokens of which I use for showcasing solidity dapps and smart contract projects. 

Binance Smart Chain testnet token/contract address        :  [0xa938c2F2C0D8aA9265846A5cc8C15b33ab87d323](https://testnet.bscscan.com/address/0xa938c2f2c0d8aa9265846a5cc8c15b33ab87d323#code)
Celo Alfajores testnet token/contract address             :  [0xF43058c49938baEF5A168Cf3D0ddCb28b6efFBB3](https://explorer.celo.org/alfajores/address/0xF43058c49938baEF5A168Cf3D0ddCb28b6efFBB3/contracts#address-tabshttps://explorer.celo.org/alfajores/address/0xF43058c49938baEF5A168Cf3D0ddCb28b6efFBB3/contracts#address-tabs)
